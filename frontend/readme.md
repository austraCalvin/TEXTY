# Texty frontend

Texty frontend is based on ReactTS and create-react-app framework. The former is a JavaScript library used in its TypeScript version in order to catch errors while developing instead of checking the error after it stopped the program from working, and the latter is a command-line tool which after executes, it creates a complete react frontend project.

## Get started
To install the dependencies needed in the frontend just do: ```npm install```

## After installing
In this folder, run ```npm start```. It will get the frontend started on the port '3000'.
